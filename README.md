## My Website Portfolio

#### Intent ####

When creating my portfolio, I had an intention of making an app that was both slick and sophisticated. Most importantly, I wanted it to contain some of my favourite elements of front-end development. For this reason, I decided to create the app with React & Canvas HTML5. 

The home page is constructed of CSS Animation and keyframes, set above some free-moving, pink particles I formulated with 'react-particles-js.'

'About Me' was inspired by a Paddle Game I made (refer to Portfolio section). I wanted an interactive game to be used to reveal my tech-stack and employable skills. Therefore, I referenced a canvas element from my React "About' component, and constructed the separate elements and classes with the use of vanilla JavaScript.

The Portfolio section was created with Bootstrap. I separated the sub-sections by a structure of 'Games', 'Database Integration' and 'API Integration' and will continue to add to this page as my tech-stack and project-load increases. 

#### Tech Stack ####

* Bootstrap - Utilised tables and columns to make pages easily responsive.
* CSS - Added keyframes to give animation and a free-flowing feel to home page. CSS was also used for the overall design and colour palette. 
* HTML - Index.html as root for React. 
* React - For overall file structure and components (representing the different pages). 
* HTML5 - For constructing the graphics with a canvas in my 'About' page. 
* Vanilla JS - Used to construct the classes and elements relating to the graphics within the canvas. 
* Particles.js (React) - For creating the underlying design of the website. 

 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Deployment ###

This site was deployed with the use of netlify. Please visit the live site <a href="https://compassionate-khorana-73d965.netlify.app/">here</a>. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
